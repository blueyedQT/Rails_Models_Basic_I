Do the following as well as making the tests pass

Create a new model called 'User' with information above
Rails will automatically create the automatic incrementing primary field called ID as well as created_at and updated_at timestamps
Create a few records in the users table using the ruby console
Get familiar with .save, .valid?, .new_record?
Make sure prior to validations, you know how to add a new record even if some of the fields are empty
Now add validations to the model so that
it requires the presence of the all four fields
it requires the age to be numeric
it requires the first_name and the last_name to be at least 2 characters each
it requires the age to be at least 10 and below 150 (look into http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Validations/HelperMethods/validates_numericality_of for some help)
use .errors and .errors.full_messages so that you can see/display the error messages when the validations are failing
Using the ruby console
see if it allows you to insert some records when the fields are not meeting the validation rules we set (e.g. try to create a record where age is 5 or above 150, or where first name is just one character, etc)
make sure your console returns appropriate error messages when you try to save something that's not meeting the validation rules
Know how to retrieve all users
Know how to get the first user
Know how to get the last user
Know how to get the users sorted by their first name (order by first_name DESC)
See ordering rules and more here:  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#ordering
Get the record of user whose id is 3 and UPDATE the person's last_name to something else. Know how to do this directly in the console using .find and .save
Know how to delete a record of a user whose id is 4 (use something like User.find(2).destroy...).
